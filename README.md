## Installation

*@knekk/spinners* doesn't need much of a setup. Just link the provided CSS in your HTML head element (or install via `npm`), and use it as an single HTML element. You can also import it and use it as a vue component.

### HTML

``` html
<!-- Copy and paste the link below into your HTML head element -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/@knekk/spinners@0.0.9/dist/kSpinners.css">
```

> **Tip:** If you only want to use one of the spinners, you can directly grap the appropriate CSS for it instead of including the whole library. See the advanced usage section...

``` bash
# Install

```
